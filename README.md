# Automated Arch Linux package for nyxt-browser

You can find a built package under the latest GitHub Actions run as an
artifact.

That artifact is also uploaded and added to my own
[Arch Linux repository][Sighery's Arch Linux repository].

## How the artifact is built

GitHub Actions is used as the CI provider to run the `makepkg` command on my
[Arch Linux Docker image][sighery/archbuilder].

After that, the package itself is then packaged into a `.tar.gz` file (so
there are [no issues with the filename][invalid artifact name characters]),
and uploaded as an artifact to that run.

The PKGBUILD and other necessary files are simply taken from the
[AUR entry][AUR nyxt-browser]. AUR entries are just Git repositories.
As such, they can be set as submodules of this repository.

Keeping the submodule updated is then up to [GitHub-native Dependabot][]. Any
updates to the AUR entry repository will trigger Dependabot to update this
submodule, which in turn will trigger the CI run.
